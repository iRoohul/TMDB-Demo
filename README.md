# TMDB-DEMO
## Overview
A sample application to show list of movies and their details using APIs from [TMDB](https://developers.themoviedb.org/) </Br></Br>

The idea is to create an app with minimum(but commonly used features) following the best practices and high coding standards. It can be used as a reference point to design the boilerplate code. As there is no silver bullet for coding standard, I have tried using the commonly used best practices, [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself) being one of them. However, as always, there exist plenty of room for improvement in the code(feedback will be appreciated :p).

<b> 1. Now Playing Screen :-</b> It is the home screen. It shows the list of Now playing movies in pagination form. Movies fetched from API gradually as the user scrolls down to the bottom.
</Br>
Home screen also has a search bar to search the movies in the list.
</Br>
<b> 2. Movie Details screen :-</b> This screen shows the details about the movie. It has multiple rows like Synopsis, Similar movies, Cast and crew details.
